As humans, we like to help one another, sometimes in small ways, sometimes in big ways.   However, there are some problems that simply cannot be solved by one person, or even five people, due to the severity and complication of the systemic roots.  To aid us in aiding others, we have developed technology to automate some of the process that makes it so complicated, but perhaps this technology has made everything more complicated rather than less.  Joshua Blumenstock, the director of the Data-Intensive Development Lab and assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Information, lays out his arguments for the current issues with using modern data and technology in his article “Don’t forget people in the use of big data for development.”  He argues that, though technology provides great potential, there are several issues with the use of technology for development that must be taken into account, namely several projects with unintentional but harmful side-effects, a lack of crosschecking data and maps, algorithms that misrepresent the poor, and a lack of legal mobility within governments in developing countries.  The idea behind all of these lies in a reliance on technology and an assumption that it is right, where there should be more focus on who is actually getting help.  Those doing the helping cannot assume that one solution will fix everything, or even fix everything from one region to the next. There are too many factors in the human condition to assume we know everything.

Humans are never perfect, and neither are algorithms and machine learning.  The goal is to conjoin both at each of their peaks, with humans at their most empathetic and technology at its most customizable.  But all of the arguments made by Blumenstock must be taken into account when creating solutions.  Like Anna Raymond said, solutions must be made with good intent, however, intentions mean nothing when the solutions harm the people they are supposed to help.  The good intentions need to carry through to the end, where everyone gets the help they need.  And good solutions cannot be found without transparency, like Nira Nair stated.  Transparency is essential for both establishing communication and building trust that will allow for the communities to give their feedback on how certain plans are affecting or could affect the community.  However, if neither side understands the other, decisions are made under assumptions, and people can get hurt, which is the exact opposite of the goal.  

One of the main problems with the intersection of human development with data science is not getting caught up in the fancy numbers and graphs.  Technology is fascinating because it is constantly changing and improving and it is understandable that data scientists often focus their energy on trying to maximize the technology that is available.  It is crucial to solving humanitarian issues to remember that behind each data point is a person, and a person is far more complex than a number.  Important decisions cannot not be derived directly from the numbers because each person may have a different situation, from one country to another, one region to another, or even one house to another.  No situation is the same, and solutions need to be formulated so they may help as many people as possible.  Of course, there are always risks but, as Kayla Seggelke states, the balancing act of weighing the risks and potential benefits is difficult but necessary for any decisions that involve human life and experience.
