There are 12 labelled urban areas across the three secondary administrative boundaries.  Outside of Arua, the main urban area, there are several urban areas that are of approximately the same density.  The populations differ as the area increases or decreases, but the densities are mostly pretty similar.  It is pretty clear to see that the larger city has more roads and healthcare access than the other cities.  Though they all have their own smaller clinics, only Arua has a hospital.  Each of the smaller cities have either a main road or a few secondary roads, and nearly all of the roads lead, in one way or another, to Arua.

This 3D render of Madi-Okolla, Vurra, and Ayivu, Uganda demonstrates that it is much easier to live in a valley or somewhere it is mosty flat.  Some of the cities creep into the mountains, but for the most part, the moutains are left untouched by the cities and roads alike.  The roads wind through the mountains, usually finding a way to go around the peaks at the base, than attempting to go over them head on.
