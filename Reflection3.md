# Reflection #3

**Question #1. How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?**

Development is often seen as a linear process with one or two “tried-and-true” methods of creating development.  Barder argues that development is far more complex than that, instead discussing the complexity of economic systems and evolution.  Amartya Sen’s definition also adds that development empowers the people so “they can live a long and healthy life.”  Compiling all of these ideas, Barder defines development as the growth of institutions, firms, and knowledge, such that the citizens can live happy and healthy lives.


**Question #2. What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?**

The toaster project was the attempt by Thomas Twaites to build a taster from scratch.  He was mostly successful, however, due to a lack of proper materials, it ended up melting, which ultimately led to failure.  This provides a healthy example of some systems being far more complex than they seem.  The toaster’s goal is to create heat to toast bread, however, the heat from the electricity, if not properly insulated, can cause problems where it was not exactly expected.  This correlates with economic systems and “fixes” to those systems that affect more areas than just the area it was supposed to fix.


**Question #3. According to Barder how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?**

Barder claims that they were very bad at describing and predicting growth.  The models projected linear growth when economic systems are far more complex than just a few numbers.  Since they projected linear growth, they also proposed linear solutions, suggesting “quick fixes” that will boost the development of developing countries.  What was not considered, was the idea that economic systems are not at all linear, and that not all systems will react the same way to the same solutions.


**Question #4. Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-lever? Was he successful? How significant were his results?**

Steve Jones was an evolutionary biologist, working on improving the spray nozzle that is used in the processing of soap powder.  Instead of scientifically attempting to construct a better nozzle as most scientists may have done, he took ten nozzles and randomly distorted each one, then tested them and picked the one that worked the best.  He repeated this process for 45 generations, and ended up with a nozzle that is hundreds of times more efficient than the original nozzle.  The results are significant because they were successful, but also because they demonstrate an important piece of development that is too often forgotten: evolution.


**Question #5. What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?**

Complex adaptive systems are complicated, unique systems that have 5 major features.  They are difficult to predict in detail, but broad predictions can be made on the system as a whole.  They have emergent properties—patterns that develop due to the interactions within the system—and they are far more complex than they seem.  Finally, they do not tend towards equilibrium, like most elements of nature do.  They can seem stable for a time, then suddenly make a large dramatic change with little to no warning.


**Question #6. Who was Haile Sellasie?  According to Barder (and Kapuscinski), how did Ethiopia during the time of The Emporer exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change?**

Emperor Haile Selassie was the last emperor of the feudal dynasty of Ethiopia in 1974.  He ruled everything, delegating roles but every ounce of authority traced back to him.  His secret police and informers kept him up to date, but no one informed him of the poverty in the countryside for fear of getting demoted.  This system has a linear point of authority, and, as Emperor Haile Selassie wanted to keep his power, it had no chance of developing to include institutions that would assist the starving citizens.  This exemplifies the suppression of emergent systemic change because the rich elite is actively ignoring the poor, which stunts any potential growth and development in those areas.  


**Question #7. Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? What did he mean by iso-morphic mimicry?**

Barder explains that since economic systems are complex adaptive systems, they cannot be predicted in detail, which makes it extremely difficult to engineer solutions.  If the system is difficult to predict normally, how can the argument be made that they can be predicted with a proposed change?  The idea is that policy makers cannot create a solution to the problem by force.  As humans determined to “fix” the problems we can see, we have a tendency to use methods that are known to work elsewhere, which Barder calls iso-morphic mimicry.  We take those methods, tweak them a little bit and assume it will work because it has worked before.  Barder suggests that we not do that, as it rarely works beyond a superficial analysis.  


**Question #8. What does Barder mean by "resist fatalism"? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?**

Norman Borlaug brought about the Green Revolution, an increased innovation of agricultural production, by using crossbreeding to optimize wheat varieties and production.  By utilizing the process of evolution, Borlaug has saved an estimated population of a billion people from starvation.  What Barder says about resisting fatalism, uses Borlaug as an example of someone who uses the evolution process to their benefit.  However, sometimes evolution does not provide positive results, so resisting fatalism involves shaping and accelerating evolution to the benefit of the community, rather than simply sticking with what evolution hands us.
