# Reflection 2

In high school, measurement was done with rulers and stopwatches.  In the crudest of ways, we measured the speed of bouncy balls and boiling temperatures and density.  But in the “real world,” everything is far more complicated.  Everything is a data point, and no two-dimensional graph can encapsulate the complexity of the planet we call home.  Big Data takes all of these data points and puts them through algorithms that find correlations that no human could have put together.

Using Big Data allow scientists in all fields to discover more and come to conclusions faster.  The algorithms can take in observational data and output correlations that would take hundreds of experiments to discover, thus rapidly decreasing the need for experimentation.  And Big Data is not limited to just one discipline.  Biology, Chemistry, Physics, etc. all use data to formulate hypothesis and conclusions.  Algorithms and models can replace the need for experimentation by finding the correlations that already exist.  However, as stated by Rob Kitchin, “the digital humanities is fostering weak, surface analysis, rather than deep, penetrating insight” (Big Data … Paradigm Shifts).  The data and algorithms bring us to correlations of observations but provide no insight into why said observations are correlated.  Big Data sorts through data looking for crude patterns in formless points, but cannot interpret the conclusions it delivers.  Instead, that is where the human takes over, creating an interesting relationship between automaton and manual work in science.  Big Data arrives at conclusions that allow human researchers to explore new correlations that have yet to be discovered and ask new questions.  

The usage of the Internet and smartphones has also introduced an exponentially growing amount of data into our lives.  There are many ways to find correlations with the usage of data and the human condition and it makes sense to use Big Data to study humans and the human psychology; however, it is infinitely more difficult.  The Big Data algorithms sort objects by finding patterns, however, human behavior is very unpredictable and chaotic, leading to a complexity that Big Data is not always capable of handling.  

This is one of the drawbacks of using Big Data.  As capable as Big Data is, it is impossible to sort humans and human behavior into neat clusters.  Attempts have been made and been semi-successful, however, as Joshua Blumenstock explains in his article “Don’t forget people in the use of big data for development,” people are often reduced to numbers in a grid when being handled by Big Data and data scientists.  The general concept of Big Data supports the need for this viewpoint, however, it is critical to remember that humans have far more complexity than, say, a leaf in the jungle.  When using Big Data to observe and solve humanitarian problems, the solutions must be verified and evaluated from a human point of view, as one solution will not befit every problem.
