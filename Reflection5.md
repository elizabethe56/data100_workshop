Data Science is a huge field that utilizes scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to collect information, interpret it and provide valuable insights and about that information.  Though data is often viewed as only numbers, data is can also be visualized as maps and images, as geospatial data.  With satellite imaging, we are able to pick apart nearly every square inch on the surface of the world.  Each square inch can then be translated from pixels to numbers, training and testing models to interpret what kind of natural or urban structures might be in that space.  This new, numerical data can then be interpreted to find urban and rural areas, rich and poor areas.  

Geoff West has capitalized on data similar to this, utilizing maps and other data to compare cities.  West compiled data on everything about cities, from population to length of roads to number of doctors, etc. to understand how cities grow.  He discovered that, within each country, the cities are proportional in size.  The largest city is approximately a scaled-up version of every other city in the country.  This research demonstrates how development and growth of economic and social systems is far more complicated than first meets the eye.  The systems are complex, meaning that every element of the system effects another in unpredictable ways.  

Data Science is not a perfect science–nothing is–but it has a huge potential to bring new insight possible solutions to world problems.  In this class, we have been focusing on using geospatial data science to determine population and urbanization in Low-to-Middle-Income-Countries.  The information we have obtained from this can be used to evaluate the status of poverty and who is or isn’t below that line.  This information can then be used to come up with solutions to aid the families who need it, so that everyone has a chance at the best life possible.  

I would be remiss if I did not mention the risks of using Data Science as well as the benefits.  There have previously been projects that attempted to fix poverty in various countries, but the cultural difference and other similar elements kept the solutions from working as intended.  It is all too easy to get caught up in the numbers, to focus too much on how we think the numbers will work.  It’s essential to remember that different regions have different cultures have different people, and no one solution will work universally.  The unpredictability of economic and social systems makes it nearly impossible to know exactly how well any change will disrupt status quo, so the solutions, especially those involving people, need to be tailored so that they work with the complex economic and social systems, not against.  The huge benefit of gaining more understanding of the complexity of these systems is that we can better understand how the system might react to certain changes so that we might be able to predict which solutions are actually viable.  

That being said, there is a huge potential for Data Science and Big Data in world problems.  Data Science has the ability to compare more elements at the same time, giving us the chance to view a bigger picture and find patterns that we would not be able to find otherwise.  When used correctly, it has the potential to aid children and families around the world by helping them get a better chance at life, but that is a long way in the future as we research and learn more and more about how exactly Big Data can and should be interpreted.
