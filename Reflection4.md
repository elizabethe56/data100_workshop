# Reflection #4

Geoff West’s largest example of scaling is cities.  Cities are attractive to people because they are full of life, ideas, and opportunity, which in turn brings together innovation and wealth.  On the other hand, they are also hubs for poverty, crime, and disease, which are often overlooked in favor of the positives the city has to offer.  West explains that all cities are essentially scales of each other regarding innovation, wealth, crime, and many other factors.  As the city size increases, so does the average citizen’s wage, production, and consumption, as well as their experience with crime, pollution, and disease.  However, due to cultural and other various differences, this is only true within each country; so, New York is not a scale of Amsterdam.  Due to this scaling law, within each country, it is possible to estimate the average wage, road length, crime rate, number of restaurants, and more, given only the size with a surprisingly high accuracy.  Each individual characteristic—number of doctors and lawyers, disease rate, diversity—plays into each other to create what we know as cities.  They don’t all seem like they influence each other, but each creates a push and pull, helping to grow urbanization.

Another scaling example is social networks.  West dives into Milgram’s “six degrees of separation” and uses it to describe the closeness of everyone on the planet.  He goes on to explain how it would be impossible for everyone in a city to interact every day, thanks to the universal constraints of time and place.  Ultimately, West concludes that social interactions, and socioeconomic metrics as a whole, increase by approximately 15 percent as the city size doubles.  This means that the average social interactions a single person maintains through entertainment, employment, crime, etc. increases at a much slower rate than the size of the city. 

West also explores a little bit of scaling in regard to companies.  It is shown that as the company grows in number of employees, so too does the net income and total assets of the company.  This demonstrates how similar companies are to organisms, even right down to their lifespans, that despite how different they appear on the surface, most companies grow under the same constraints as all the rest.

All three of these examples dive into ideas about humans that are usually not explored from this angle.  The cities are all hustle and bustle and it is not obvious that the length of the roads might be connected to the rate of crime.  The scaling law provides a framework for researching the growth of cities and allows for researchers to extend research from one city to the next.  This data can then be used to estimate the growth of the current cities, and even the development of new ones as the human population continue to grow and urbanize.  

West’s opinions on big data are full of warnings.  There are many people with the incorrect assumption that any data is good data, however there are many dangers in thinking this.  While data is the very basis for our understanding, it is crucial that it is obtained, used, and displayed properly to prevent confusion and misunderstandings.  If there is too much data, and yes there is such a thing as too much data, the numbers can get jumbled, and the important data can get hidden by irrelevant noise. It is also possible for the data to provide false correlations, creating incorrect assumptions about the relations of data sets.  It is not always obvious when two data sets are not related, so it is crucial for the researcher to be wary of data that may lead to incorrect conclusions.  All of this, however, does not mean that big data should not be used.  West also explains how big data is likely the future of scientific enterprise, and therefore the future of all aspects of life.  When combined with scientific methodology, big data can lead to scientific discoveries we never had the chance of reaching before.  With the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), there is a conceptual framework and mathematical theory for sorting through data relating to the Higgs particle.  Without big data, it would not have been possible to sort through all of the noise and make the discovery.  As long as the big data has a theoretical framework for understanding, big data can and will change the world.
